### Notes

THe objective of this project is getting familiar with different sorts of technologies working together. Mainly redux and typescript were heavily used. When coming to redux toolkit a custom api was created 'mockick' the firebase api to manage all back end requests. While there are better methods to design a project like this with redux, again the main goal was using most of the framework's funtionalities. Firebase observers and toolkit's mutation were integrated in custom hooks to manage different messaging interfaces.
